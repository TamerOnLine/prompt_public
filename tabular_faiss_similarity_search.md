### üîç Similarity Search on Tabular Data using FAISS

**üìå Overview:** Tabular data can be transformed into numerical vectors using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE). FAISS enables searching for similar records.

**üìñ Step-by-step Guide:**

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load your tabular data into a suitable format such as pandas DataFrame in Python.
   - Handle missing values by either removing rows with missing values or filling them with appropriate values.
   - Normalize numerical columns if necessary to ensure that the features have similar scales.

2. Vectorization:
   - Choose a vectorization method, for instance, TF-IDF for text data or Word2Vec, or use a deep learning model like Autoencoders or siamese networks for more complex data types. For tabular data, we typically use techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to normalize the data and then apply one of these methods:
     - Dense Vector Representation (DVR)
     - Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
     - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
     - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
     - Autoencoders
   - Once you have chosen a method, apply it to your preprocessed data to obtain vector representations for each row.

3. Indexing:
   - Install the FAISS library by running `!pip install faiss` if using Python or follow the appropriate installation instructions for your preferred programming language.
   - Create an instance of a Flat index, which is suitable for high-dimensional vector data. For example, in Python, you can do:
     ```python
     from faiss import *
     index = IndexFlatL2(vector_dim)  # vector_dim should be the dimensionality of your vectors
     ```
   - Load the precomputed vector representations into this index using `index.add(data)`, where `data` is a NumPy array containing the vectors for all rows in your data.

4. Querying:
   - Load a new vector representation of the query you want to search for and add it to the index if necessary (using `index.add()`) or simply use it as a search key directly.
   - Use the `search()` method on the index to find similar vectors. For example, in Python:
     ```python
     D, I = index.search(new_vector, k)  # k is the number of nearest neighbors you want to return
     ```
   - The returned values are two arrays: `D` contains the pairwise distances between the query vector and the vectors in your data, sorted in ascending order; `I` contains the indices of the corresponding rows in your data.

5. Post-processing (optional):
   - You can further process the results by applying a threshold on the distances or using other techniques like clustering to group similar items together.
