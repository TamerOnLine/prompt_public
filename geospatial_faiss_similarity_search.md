**üìå Overview:** Geospatial data (e.g., coordinates, maps) can be embedded using specialized techniques (e.g., spatial embeddings). FAISS enables quick geospatial similarity retrieval.

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect geospatial data in a format suitable for analysis. This could be in the form of latitude, longitude, and additional attributes like location names, elevations, etc.
   - Ensure that your data is clean and well-structured to avoid errors during further processing.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Geohashing: Convert geographical coordinates into a string of hashes using Geohash or similar methods. This method reduces the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to handle. For example, converting (latitude, longitude) pairs into 8-character Geohashes.
   - Normalization: Normalize the resulting geohashes to ensure that the distance metric is meaningful. One common normalization method for geohashes is the Hamming Distance.

3. **Vectorization**
   - Create vector representations of your preprocessed geospatial data points. In the case of FAISS, we will use a technique called `Flat L2 Normalization`. This involves transforming each Geohash into an embedding vector in a flat Euclidean space.
   - For every unique Geohash obtained from your dataset, compute its Flat L2 normalized vector using the formula:
     ```
     v = 1 / sqrt(n) * [h_0, h_1, ..., h_(n-1)]
     ```
     where `v` is the final vector, `h_i` are the individual geohash digits, and `n` is the total number of digits in your Geohash (e.g., 8 for 8-character Geohashes).

4. **Indexing**
   - Choose an appropriate FAISS index type based on your use case. For large datasets, consider using IVF (Instance Normalized Hashing) or FAISS's new LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) indices.
   - Create an instance of the chosen index and populate it with your vectorized data points:
     ```
     idx = IndexFlatL2(metric=metrics.euclidean)  # For Euclidean distance metric
     idx.add(vectorized_data)
     ```

5. **Searching**
   - Query the index with a new vector to find similar data points:
     ```
     query_vector = FlatL2Normalize([query_geohash_digits])  # Normalize the query Geohash and convert it into an embedding vector
     distances, indices = idx.search(query_vector, k=10)  # Find the top 10 nearest neighbors
     ```
   - Retrieve the corresponding data points from your original dataset based on the returned indices:
     ```
     results = [data[indices[i]] for i in range(len(distances))]
     ```

6. **Evaluation**
   - Perform an evaluation of your search performance by calculating metrics such as recall, precision, and F1-score using a ground truth dataset. This will help you understand how well your index is performing and identify areas for improvement if needed.
