### üîç Similarity Search on Video Data using FAISS

**üìå Overview:** Videos can be processed by extracting key frames and converting them into feature vectors using CNNs. FAISS can store these feature vectors to enable video similarity search.

**üìñ Step-by-step Guide:**

To perform similarity search on video data using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), you'll need to follow several steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Extract relevant features from the videos. This can be done using techniques like optical flow, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), or convolutional neural networks (CNN). For this example, let's assume we have extracted a fixed-length 128-dimensional feature vector for each video frame.
   - Collect a dataset of videos and their corresponding features. Ensure the dataset has enough diversity to capture various types of videos.

2. Vector Quantization (VQ):
   - Normalize all the feature vectors to have zero mean and unit length. This is important because FAISS's indexing and search algorithms work better with normalized data.
   - Apply vector quantization (VQ) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors while preserving their similarities. You can use the provided `ivfcluster` function in FAISS to perform this step. The `ivfcluster` function applies k-means clustering and returns the cluster centers, which serve as the codebook for vector quantization.
   - Quantize each feature vector by finding its closest center in the codebook. This will result in a compressed representation of the original feature vectors while maintaining their similarities.

3. Building an Index:
   - Create an instance of `IndexFlatL2` or `IndexIVFFlatL2` class, depending on whether you want to use flat L2 distance for similarity search or approximate nearest neighbors search (IVF stands for Iterative Refinement).
   - Populate the index with the quantized feature vectors and their corresponding labels. You can achieve this by calling the `add` method on the created index instance multiple times, passing in a batch of quantized feature vectors and their associated labels at each call.

4. Training:
   - Train the index by calling the `train` method on the created index instance. This step optimizes the codebook to better represent the data distribution.

5. Searching:
   - Perform similarity search using the `search` method on the trained index instance. Pass in a query feature vector and desired number of nearest neighbors to find. The returned results will be the indices (and their corresponding labels) of the closest videos in the dataset to the query.

Here's a minimal example in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from faiss import IndexFlatL2, ivfcluster

# Assuming you have a list of feature vectors 'features' and their corresponding labels 'labels'

# Normalize the feature vectors
means = np.mean(features, axis=0)
stddevs = np.std(features, axis=0)
features_norm = (features - means) / stddevs

# Vector quantization using k-means clustering with 128 centers
codebook = ivfcluster(features_norm, 128)

# Quantize the feature vectors
quantized_vectors = features_norm[np.argmin(np.linalg.norm(features_norm - codebook, axis=1), axis=0)]

# Create an index with L2 distance and 16 centers per shard (for IVF)
index = IndexFlatL2(128)

# Populate the index with quantized feature vectors and their labels
index.add(quantized_vectors, np.array(labels))

# Train the index
index.train()

# Perform a search query on the trained index
query_vector = features_norm[0]  # Replace this with your actual query vector
num_neighbors = 5
distances, indices = index.search(np.array([query_vector]), num_neighbors)

# Retrieve the labels of the nearest neighbors
labels_of_nn = np.array(labels)[indices]
```
